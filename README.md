Alright so at the time of making this repository, I was really only coding in Python, and when I started to get into competitive programming, I realized how slow Python was. That is why,
I decided to learn C++. Note that the 30 days are not consistent, as there were many ups and downs during the whole journey, including my send-up exams, me being brutally sick, and just 
me overall not being able to keep up with demands.
